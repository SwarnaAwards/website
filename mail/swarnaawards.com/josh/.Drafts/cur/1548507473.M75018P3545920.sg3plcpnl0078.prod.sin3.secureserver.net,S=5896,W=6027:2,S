Hello Jimmy, 

Thank you for writing in. 

We appreciate the proposal from your organisation regarding promoting
your brand in India. 

As requested, we contacted the team of Shah Rukh Khan. We found that, he
is already endorsing several well-known organisations/companies. As your
company has not yet been introduced in India and that people are not
aware of your company/brand, we wish to suggest that, the best option
would be to create brand awareness in Indian market through films and
media. This is the best way to reach the general public. 

If you are going with international superstars at this stage, you might
have to pay huge remuneration to them. Hence, to be cost effective we
suggest to promote your brand at regional level and create brand
awareness. This way you can attract more investors and customers. 

We assure that, all the artists associated with P. J. B. Productions
Pvt. Ltd. will support and promote your brand through our projects. 

Looking forward for a long lasting relationship.
